Avali are sapient, technologically-advanced alien creatures originating on the moon Avalon.
Their appearance resembles closely to an Earth-based, Cretaceous period Deinonychus.
Avali are fully feathered, bipedal creatures with distinctive large eyes, four rabbit-like ears attached to their head, and two wings with three dexterous digits, capable of manipulating objects.
They are unassuming at first glance, with a nonthreatening appearance to humans.
On Avalon, they evolved to be excellent fliers.
Despite their large brains and flying capabilities, metabolic rates for Avali are slow compared to humans, tied to the cold natural temperatures of Avalon.
On average, the weight of Avali is about 27-31 kg or 60-68 lbs.
