\section*{\textcolor{orangebold}{冰与羽}}
\noindent\textcolor{orangebold}{\rule{\linewidth}{2pt}}

在一颗气态巨行星旁边紧邻着一颗名为 Avalon 的不起眼冰卫星静静地活跃着。
The thick clouds shroud the cold rock from the outside, but the world churns away.
Life flourishes within the dark, cold moon, both familiar and alien. Indeed, life had found an unusual spot in the large galaxy.
The moon turns as the creatures that inhabit it continue about their day, none the wiser, as this has been their home for eons.

The clacking of talons and fluttering of
feathers can be heard, muted only by the wind
and the swaying of alien plant life. Creatures
scurry across the ice and snow, followed by
machines of steel and plastics. Technology,
whirring calmly across the world, thoroughly
cemented and operated by a small race of ice
raptors who call themselves Avali.

The Avali continue about their day, no
different from any other. The inhospitable cold
means nothing to them. The Avali push through
the sharp winds and dense snow as if it wasn't
there. They live here. They evolved here. To
them, it's like a warm day at the beach.

The Avali are small, feathered creatures
that evolved to have complex problem-solving
skills. Resembling a lot like raptors, Avali also
have two pairs of ears, which they use to
navigate their world. While they have eyes,
their primary sense involves their ears. These
ice raptors are frequently found in packs. They
have developed and harnessed technologies
that have pushed them into space, allowing for
the extraction of resources within their star
system. Their cute appearance has made them
unassuming to most onlookers; however, their
razor-sharp talons and teeth are not to be
underestimated.

\section*{起源}

The Avali (plural "Avali," adjective
"Avalian") and their concepts were created by
RyuujinZERO. Initially created in the EA-Maxis'
game "Spore," the race was originally known as
Iubati, based on the Latin word meaning "crest"
or "crested." Their first sight was seen in early
2009 and published in "Sporepedia." Ryuujin
would start to lay the foundations of the frozen
home world, the heavy use of technologies and
artificial intelligence algorithms, and some
vehicle concepts that the Iubati utilized. Here,
the original ideas of Avali can be seen.
