在一颗气态巨行星旁边紧邻着一颗名为 Avalon 的不起眼冰卫星静静地活跃着。浓厚的云层笼罩着这颗卫星冰冷的岩石表面，但其内部非常的活跃。
Life flourishes within the dark, cold moon, both familiar and alien. Indeed, life had found an unusual spot in the large galaxy.
The moon turns as the creatures that inhabit it continue about their day, none the wiser, as this has been their home for eons.

The clacking of talons and fluttering of feathers can be heard, muted only by the wind and the swaying of alien plant life.
Creatures scurry across the ice and snow, followed by machines of steel and plastics. Technology, whirring calmly across the world, thoroughly cemented and operated by a small race of ice raptors who call themselves Avali.

The Avali continue about their day, no different from any other. The inhospitable cold means nothing to them.
The Avali push through the sharp winds and dense snow as if it wasn't there.
They live here. They evolved here. To them, it's like a warm day at the beach.

% ! 此部分对`The Avali are small, feathered creatures that evolved to have complex problem-solving skills.'进行了裁剪。
Avali 是一种长有羽毛的小型生物，长得很像猛禽，有着两对耳朵用来辨别方位。虽然长有眼睛，但耳朵才是主要的感官。这些生物经常成群出现。
可爱多外表让大多数旁观者觉得它们毫无威胁。但它们那锋利的爪子和牙齿不可小觑。
它们还开发了进入太空的技术，使得可以从其他星系中获取资源。

\section*{起源}

Avali（复数“Avali”，形容词“Avalian”）其概念由 RyuujinZERO 创造。
最初该种族叫“Iubati”，源自拉丁语，意思是“冠（crest）”或“有冠的（crested）”，在 EA-Maxis 的游戏“孢子（Spore）”中被创建，于 2009 年初首次亮相，并发布在 “Sporepedia” 上。
随后，Ryuujin 便开始为它们奠定设定基础，其中包括冰冻的家园（母星）、大量使用的技术和人工智能算法，以及 Iubati 实际采用的一些载具概念。
你可以在下面的内容看到 Avali 最初的想法。

冒险故事是使用 EA-Maxis 的“孢子：银河冒险”扩展包构建的。
后来，Ryuujin 在《孢子》中制作了一个叫“Whom Gods Destroy”的自定义故事任务。
% ! 此处的`artifacts`翻译暂定`遗物`
故事本身是一个科幻、恐怖、悲剧题材，将玩家置于船长的视角，在贫瘠的世界中寻找遗物，结果他们的小冒险却出了差错。

2014 年，Ryuujin 开始为呵呵鱼（Chucklefish）即将推出的游戏“星界边境（Starbound）”开发新种族。她采用了“孢子”中的 Avali 概念并继续发展完善该物种。
在《星界边境》中，Avali 的社会和群居系统、饮食习惯、文化和生物学特征等都得到了进一步的完善。
在2014 年 4 月，Ryuujin 正式发布了《星界边境》的 Avali 模组。

Today, the Avali fandom continues to keep the species alive.
A small community has developed around the little ice raptors, partly thanks to their cute appearance and online presence.
Multiple game mods and adaptations have also incorporated Avali into new stories and adventures. Additionally,
the fandom has continued to create fan art and stories involving race.

Official development of the Avali race
has stagnated since its peak in 2015. Although
not abandoned by Ryuujin, her priority for the
race is not as significant as they were during the
initial "Starbound" development periods. In
response, the community has slowly continued
their development of the species, creating
alternate lore and cultures for the Avali. The
openness of the race allows for it to be mingled
into otherwise prohibitive universes.

While this book is a comprehensive
guide to the species, it is not official lore. The
Avali lore is compiled into chapters and sections
in this book. Each section will break down and
explain certain aspects of the Avali from a
subjective viewpoint and in intricate detail.
Additionally, the development of the species
will continue further, following closely in the
footsteps of Ryuujin.
